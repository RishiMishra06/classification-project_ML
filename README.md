Classification Project on Mobile Price Range Prediction.  

Project Name :- Mobile Price Range Prediction.  

Project Overview:-  

This project predicts the price range category of mobile phones based on their technical specifications using machine learning classification techniques. It helps customers and sellers estimate the pricing tier (e.g., low, medium, high, premium) of a mobile device from features like RAM, battery power, camera resolution, and more.

Dataset:-
* The dataset consists of various mobile phone features including:

* Battery power

* RAM

* Internal memory

* Camera megapixels (front and back)

* Screen size

* And other hardware specifications

The target variable is the price_range with categories representing different price levels.

Technologies Used:-
1. Python

2. Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)

3. Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)

4. Scikit-learn (Machine learning algorithms)

Project Workflow:-  

1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the feature distributions and relationships.

3.Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and transforming data for better model performance.

4.Model Building: Training classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

5.Model Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy, precision, recall, and fine-tuning hyperparameters.

Results:-  

1.Achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test dataset.

2.Logistic Regression proved to be the most effective in predicting price ranges.

3.This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in price range prediction for mobile devices.

How to run:
